# Firmware and serial logging

Open this directory (`src` in the repository) as the PlatformIO project.
Its source directory is `src/src`, including `basebot_6.ino`.

Use PlatformIO's normal **Upload and Monitor** action. The project hook in
`scripts/wait_for_monitor.py` waits up to 30 seconds for the Teensy's USB serial
port to reappear and remain present for one second after uploading. It only
enumerates USB devices and never opens the serial port. This prevents
PlatformIO's one-time wildcard lookup from missing the rebooting board and
stopping at `Enter port index or full name` before the logger starts.
The hook reports `Teensy USB serial ready: ...` before the monitor opens.
After upload succeeds, the monitor automatically starts recording to `src/logs`. Its
startup output must include `Logging an output to .../src/logs/...` and the
Teensy's `/dev/cu.usbmodem...` port. The project also forces DTR active, which
the Teensy requires to recognize an attached serial reader. Wait for that
startup output, then press the robot's run button once. A completed run is
sent and saved automatically; no `log` command is required.

If the logging startup line never appears, the file writer has not started.
Check the task's upload result and that it is using this `platformio.ini`;
the firmware cannot create a file on the computer without an active monitor.
Only one monitor should own the serial port at a time.
Before repeating the task, terminate the previous monitor task using the
terminal's trash button. Leave the monitor open while executing a run.
The optional **Terminal → Run Task → Upload and Monitor (automatic logging)**
task uses the same combined upload/monitor command and project hook. Close
this custom task before uploading again; PlatformIO's automatic monitor
closure handles its own built-in tasks, but does not handle custom process tasks.

If an already running monitor is stopped at `Enter port index or full name`,
the startup lookup has already failed. Enter the full current robot port
(for example `/dev/cu.usbmodem145870301`) in that existing terminal to connect
without uploading again. Keep the robot powered: a completed capture pending
in RAM is transmitted when the monitor connects. Future combined uploads use
the project hook automatically. A new log file is created when the monitor
connects, even before a robot run; no new file means the file logger has not
started, rather than an empty firmware capture.

PlatformIO's VS Code extension installs its command-line tools in
`~/.platformio/penv/bin`, which may not be on your terminal's `PATH`.
No separate installation is needed. For an optional monitor-only session,
this command works from any directory:

```sh
"$HOME/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio" run \
  --project-dir "$HOME/Autumn2026/digital-control-2026/src" \
  --target monitor --environment teensy41
```

Close an existing monitor before starting another. The normal VS Code
**Upload and Monitor** action already uses the installed executable directly;
it does not require `pio` to be available in your shell. The `pio` shorthand
in the diagnostic commands below refers to `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio`.

The configured monitor port matches `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS, excluding
Bluetooth devices and the debug console. Check the port in the monitor's
startup banner. If multiple USB serial devices are connected, use
`pio device list` and pass the Teensy's port explicitly with `--port`.
The Teensy has USB vendor/product ID `16C0:0483`.

For diagnostics, `log` plus Enter requests the samples already held in RAM;
it does not start the motors. Even with no samples, the robot prints a header
and `% sent 0 log lines`. The current firmware prints
`% 25-26 computed control signal (left,right) (V)` in the header.

To capture a new run, keep the monitor open and press the robot's start button.
The current forward sequence takes about 3.6 seconds (0.2 seconds at rest,
3 seconds driving at 0.02 m/s, and 0.4 seconds settling). The 420 kB buffer
holds 3750 samples at 1 ms with the current 112-byte rows, covering the full run.
The firmware applies zero PWM before printing the completed log. It waits
for a connected USB serial monitor before automatically sending a completed
capture, so opening the monitor after the run can still retrieve the output.
Wait for `% sent ... log lines` before closing the
monitor with Ctrl+C. Output is saved to `logs/device-monitor-YYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`.
If a run finished before the monitor opened, a pending capture is sent when
the monitor connects. `log` can optionally repeat a transfer while the robot
remains powered; rebooting or starting another run replaces the samples.
Requests during a run are rejected so serial printing cannot stall motor
control. A buffer allocation failure prevents starting a run; if a future
sequence exceeds capacity, its log includes a warning about missing samples.

For manual builds and uploads, use PlatformIO:

```sh
pio run -e teensy41 -t clean
pio run -e teensy41
pio run -e teensy41 -t upload
```

The legacy `compile` and `upload` scripts target the old Arduino build in
`build`, whose HEX file can be stale. Use the PlatformIO upload command to
flash `.pio/build/teensy41/firmware.hex`.
